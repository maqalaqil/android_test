# Blackgem-challenge

Android challange description:

In general the application will fetch data from an [API](url), store the data into a local database then display the data.
The application UI , seen below, will contain two fragments. 
The first fragment will display all the news coming from the API above and display them in a recyclerview.
The second fragment will contain a google map that will pin the location of the news occurrences, provided by the JSON response.

# UI Sketch.

![map fragment](/images/map-fragment.png)  
The title is the news title. It showes when you click on the pin.  
![news fragment](/images/news-fragment.png)  
The read more doesn't do anything in this version.  

Once you switch from a fragment to the second the fragment icon should be highlighted.

_Note_: Download the **Assets.zip** to find all the icons you need.
The menu and magnifying glass (search icon) can be found in the Material.io website or added through android stusdio asset.
They are only for visual preview and do not have any behaviour.

You can preview the UX behaviour throughout the following [link](https://xd.adobe.com/view/34f42135-ad4e-48e2-51e2-9841e4057070-42c5/?fullscreen)
